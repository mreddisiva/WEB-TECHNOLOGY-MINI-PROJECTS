    <h2><b><i>STORY :</i></b></h2>
    <p>
        In the year 2145, humanity has expanded its reach into the farthest corners of the galaxy. The spaceship TITAN is sent on a
        critical mission to explore a newly discovered planet capable of sustaining life. Captain Alex Reynolds leads a diverse
        crew of scientists, engineers, and military personnel into unknown territory filled with breathtaking landscapes and
        unforeseen dangers.
        <br><br>
        As the crew lands and begins to explore, they encounter strange alien technology and signals hinting at an ancient civilization.
        Tensions rise as mysterious events threaten the safety of the crew, forcing them to confront both external threats and internal
        conflicts. Dr. Elena Torres works tirelessly to decode the alien messages, while Sergeant Priya Singh maintains order under pressure.
        <br><br>
        Meanwhile, the bond between crew members is tested by secrets from their pasts, and as the mission unfolds, they must rely on
        trust, courage, and their combined skills to survive and unlock the secrets of the TITAN’s destination before it's too late.
